# Interior regularity witnesses for the shifted resolvents

The interior regularity witness that indexes the analytic resolvent on bounded
data, and the two hypotheses that supply it.

The interior estimates the divergence-form layer consumes are packaged here as
predicates on the coefficient field: `HasContinuousShiftedResolvents` for a
continuous representative on the open set, and `HasLocalHolderShiftedResolvents`
and `HasLocalHolderPenalizedResolvents` for the local Hölder form.

Stating the layer against a witness rather than against a smallness hypothesis
keeps the analytic input in one place: a caller supplies the witness once and
every downstream statement is indexed by it.

/-- **The interior regularity witness.**  For every positive shift and every
`L²` datum with an essential bound, the shifted resolvent has a representative
continuous on the open domain.  No boundary value is asserted, and no bound on
the representative is asserted: the statement mentions only the `L²` class. -/

/-- **The freezing route to the witness.**  A coefficient whose symmetric part
is the scalar field `nu • 1` and whose skew part is continuous on the domain has
continuous interior representatives, with no restriction on the size of the
skew part. -/

/-- **Restriction of the freezing route to a subdomain.**  The witness itself
does not restrict along `V ⊆ U`, because the resolvent of `V` is a different
operator; the hypotheses of the freezing route do, so the witness for the
subdomain is available whenever the coefficient is continuous on `U`. -/

variable [NeZero d]

/-- **The quantitative interior regularity witness.**  It adds one clause to
`HasContinuousShiftedResolvents`: at every point of the domain there is a
radius, depending on the point but not on the datum, on which every
representative of the shifted resolvent of a datum with essential bound `M`
that is continuous there obeys the explicit interior Hölder bound of the
small-contrast Schauder estimate, with gradient budget `(min mu lam)⁻¹ ‖f‖` and
forcing budget `B * M`.  The radius does not see the datum at all, and the
constant sees it only through `‖f‖` and `M`.  On a bounded domain the first of
these is controlled by the second, since `‖f‖ ≤ M * |U| ^ (1 / 2)`, and the
constant is increasing in its gradient budget; so the bound is uniform over
every family of data with a common essential bound. -/
