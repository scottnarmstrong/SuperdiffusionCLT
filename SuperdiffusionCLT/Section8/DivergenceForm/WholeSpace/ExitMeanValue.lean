# Nonnegativity of the one-point extension

The exit decomposition of a resolvent datum is an extended-real statement, so
it is carried by nonnegative continuous data vanishing at infinity.  This file
records the one fact about the one-point extension that the decomposition
needs: the extension of a nonnegative function is nonnegative, at the added
point as well as on the live space.
