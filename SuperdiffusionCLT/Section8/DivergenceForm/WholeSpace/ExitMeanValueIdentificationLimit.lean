# The vanishing-shift limit of the zero-trace solutions on an exhaustion cube

The Dirichlet resolvent of a bounded measurable datum on an exhaustion cube is the value
component of a zero-trace carrier element, the solution of the shifted weak equation.  This file
shows that this carrier element converges as the shift decreases to zero, and identifies the
value component of the limit with the Green potential of the exit mean-value development.

The convergence is a genuine energy estimate, not a compactness argument.  Subtracting the weak
equations at two shifts and testing against the difference gives

  `nu * ‖grad (Z_s - Z_t)‖² ≤ t ⟪Z_t, Z_s - Z_t⟫ - s ⟪Z_s, Z_s - Z_t⟫`,

whose right-hand side is at most `(s + t)` times a constant, because the shift-uniform
supremum bound of the Dirichlet resolvents bounds every `Z_lam` in `L²` uniformly in the shift.
The Poincare inequality on the carrier converts the gradient estimate into a carrier-norm
estimate, so the family is Cauchy as the shift decreases to zero and the carrier is complete.

The limit solves the *unshifted* weak equation, because the term carrying the shift vanishes.
