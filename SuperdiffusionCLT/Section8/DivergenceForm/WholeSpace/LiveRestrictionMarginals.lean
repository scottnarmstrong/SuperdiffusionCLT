# Post-composition of continuous paths, and the live embedding

`pathPostcomp` is the post-composition of a continuous path with a continuous map of the state
space.  It is continuous, and it reads at a finite set of times as the coordinatewise state map.

`liveEmbedding` is the coercion of a state space into its one-point compactification, read as a
map into path space; the coercion itself is injective.

Nothing here constructs a process: every statement is about a deterministic operation on path
space.
