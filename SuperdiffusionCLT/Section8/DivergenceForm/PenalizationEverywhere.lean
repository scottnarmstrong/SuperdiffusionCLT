# Everywhere convergence of the penalized resolvents on the part domain

Everywhere convergence of the penalized resolvents inside the part domain.

The penalization limit is available almost everywhere on the part domain `V`.
This file upgrades it to a statement at every point of `V`, using only the
uniform interior estimate: no compactness argument is needed, because the
sequence is pointwise decreasing.

The route is: continuous representatives of the penalized resolvents on `V`
(interior estimate plus local-to-global gluing); pointwise monotonicity and
nonnegativity everywhere on `V` (almost everywhere identities between
functions continuous on the open set `V`); the pointwise infimum, which
inherits the index-free Hölder bound and is therefore continuous; and the
identification of that infimum with the continuous representative of the part
resolvent.

Nothing is asserted on the boundary of `V`.

/-- **The freezing route.**  Inside the part domain the penalization potential
vanishes, so the penalized solution satisfies the unpenalized shifted equation
there and the uniform energy bound supplies the index-free gradient budget.
Freezing at the point then gives one radius and one constant for the whole
sequence, with no restriction on the size of the skew part. -/

/-- **Everywhere penalization limit on the part domain.**  The penalized
resolvents have continuous representatives on `V` that decrease pointwise and
converge, at every point of `V`, to the continuous representative of the part
resolvent; the pointwise infimum is that representative.  The index-free
Hölder constant of the quantitative witness is what makes the infimum
continuous.  The limit's own representative is not produced here: it is the one
named by `hRegV`, at the restricted datum, and the content of the theorem is
the monotone pointwise convergence to it.  Nothing is asserted on the boundary
of `V`. -/
