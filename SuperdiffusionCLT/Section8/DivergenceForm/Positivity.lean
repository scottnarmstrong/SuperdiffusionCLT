# Positivity and normalized alpha-shifted resolvent bounds

This module records fixed-coefficient, bounded-domain maximum-principle
estimates for the alpha-shifted divergence-form resolvent on its `ScalarL2`
carrier.  They are the zero-potential case of the corresponding estimates for
the resolvent with a bounded nonnegative potential.  All conclusions are
almost-everywhere statements with respect to `volumeMeasureOn U`: nonnegative
forcing gives a nonnegative resolvent, forcing bounded above by one gives an
upper bound of one after multiplication by the shift, and forcing in `[0, 1]`
is preserved by that normalized resolvent.  These are analytic `L2` results
only; this module does not construct a kernel, semigroup, or stochastic
process.
