# Real observables on the one-point carrier

Zero extension of a real observable to the one-point compactification.

The conservative model semigroup lives on `OnePoint X`, and observables of the
live space are read there by extending them by `0` at the point at infinity.
The library provides this extension for `ℝ≥0∞`-valued observables
(`onePointLiveExtension`); the real-valued version used by the comparison on
bounded measurable data is provided here, with the same measurability proof.

The statements are generic and belong with the kernel layer of the
MarkovProcess library, which is left unmodified here.
