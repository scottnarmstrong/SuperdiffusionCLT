# Linearity of the zero extension of bounded measurable data

Algebraic properties of the analytic resolvent on bounded measurable data.

The zero extension of a bounded measurable function on the domain is additive
and homogeneous, hence so is its `L²` class.  These are the closure properties
used by the monotone-class comparison with the process resolvent.
