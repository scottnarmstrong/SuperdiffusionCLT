# Same-coefficient resolvent comparison

This file records the fixed-coefficient almost-everywhere comparison principle
for the shifted resolvent as the zero-potential case of the comparison
principle for the resolvent with a bounded nonnegative potential.

The domain, coefficient field, and operator parameters are fixed. This is an
almost-everywhere analytic result on `ScalarL2` only; it does not compare
different coefficient fields or parameters, and it does not construct a
sub-Markov family, semigroup, kernel, or process.

/-- The alpha-shifted resolvent preserves almost-everywhere order when the

by the later weak comparison principle. -/
