# Pointwise exponential decay away from the transition layer

This module assembles the exponentially weighted mass estimate, the conversion
of that estimate into a local `L²` bound, and the interior pointwise estimate
into a single statement: a bounded solution decays exponentially away from the
region where the localization is not yet constant, at the rate

`kappa * alpha / (alpha + d / 2)`,

where `kappa` is any rate admissible for the weighted estimate, in particular
`sqrt (lam * mass) / (2 * sqrt 2 * Lam)`.

The geometry enters only through four checkable conditions: the localization
is one near the point, the phase is at least `tx` near the point, the phase is
at most `tA` wherever the localization is not locally constant, and
`tA <= tx`.

What the estimate costs, stated plainly.  The dimension satisfies `2 <= d`;
`d = 1` is excluded, because the interior Hölder modulus comes from the
Schauder estimate on balls, which is stated for `2 <= d`.  The radius `r` of
that ball is arbitrary: any `0 < r` with `euclideanBall x r` inside the
domain will do, and the constant carries the explicit powers of `r`, so the
estimate may be applied at a small scale near the boundary.  The localization
and phase conditions are read on `euclideanBall x (r / 2)`, the largest
radius the balance uses.  The Hölder exponent satisfies `alpha` in
`[1/2, 1)`, and the coefficient field is within
`smallContrastThreshold d alpha` of the identity.  The constant is a sum of
two terms, not a single multiple of the uniform bound: the weighted `L²`
term, carrying `M`, the layer constant `Ceta` and the measure `volLayer` of
the transition layer, plus an additive Schauder summand built from the local
gradient size `E` and the forcing bound `G`; both are multiplied by the
exponential factor.  Finally the conclusion is a per-point existential: some
function continuous on `euclideanBall x (r / 2)` and almost everywhere equal
to the solution on `euclideanBall x r` is small at `x`.
`Decay/Representative.lean` transfers that bound to any fixed continuous
representative.
