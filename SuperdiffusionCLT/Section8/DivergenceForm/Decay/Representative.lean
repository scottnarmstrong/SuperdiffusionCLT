# Transferring a bound to a fixed continuous representative

The pointwise estimates of this directory end in an existential: some
function, continuous on a ball and almost everywhere equal to the solution
there, has a small value at the centre.  A consumer usually carries a
continuous representative of its own and needs the bound for that one.

The transfer is the standard fact that two functions continuous on an open
set and almost everywhere equal there agree at every point of it, because
Lebesgue measure is positive on nonempty open sets.  That fact is
`MeasureTheory.Measure.eqOn_open_of_ae_eq`; the statements below are its
specialization to Euclidean balls, in the shape the pointwise estimates hand
over.  Two representatives of the same solution are almost everywhere equal
to each other by transitivity, so no further hypothesis is needed.
