# Balancing an averaged term against a Hölder term

The interior pointwise estimate bounds a value by an `L²` average on a ball of
radius `rho` plus a Hölder modulus of order `rho ^ alpha`.  When the `L²` term
already carries an exponential factor `exp (-(kappa * s))`, choosing
`rho = R * exp (-(kappa * s) / (alpha + d / 2))` balances the two and produces
the reduced exponential rate `kappa * alpha / (alpha + d / 2)`.

The cap `R` on the admissible radii is a parameter, so the statement is scale
free: it may be as small as the consumer's ball allows, and the constant is
simply the two-term bound evaluated at `R`.  Because the balancing radius is
`R` times a factor at most one, it is always admissible, so there is no case
distinction and no lost constant factor.
