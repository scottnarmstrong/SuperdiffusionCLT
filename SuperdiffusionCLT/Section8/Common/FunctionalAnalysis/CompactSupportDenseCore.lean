# Compactly supported functions as a dense core of `C₀`

This file realizes compactly supported bounded continuous functions as a norm-preserving
continuous linear subspace of `C₀`.  On a locally compact regular space, its inclusion has dense
range.  The density proof cuts a function off by a compactly supported Urysohn function.

This is purely functional-analytic infrastructure.  In applications to divergence-form
regularity, a separate support-preserving smoothing argument can refine this continuous core to a
smooth compactly supported core.
