# Sphere averages and the mean value property

The reproducing-convolution route of the Schauder gradient-Hölder estimate rests on the
**mean value property** of harmonic functions.  This module builds it:

* `sphereAverage f x r` — the average of `f` over the sphere of radius `r`
  around `x`, realized as an integral over the **unit** sphere so that the
  radius is a smooth parameter;
* `hasDerivAt_sphereAverage` — differentiation under the integral sign in the
  radius;
* the mean value property itself: a function whose spherical flux vanishes has
  a radius-independent sphere average, hence equals its own sphere average.

/-- **Radial derivative of the spherical average.**  For a `C¹` function `u`, the spherical average
`r ↦ sphereAverage x r u` is differentiable at every `r₀`, with derivative the spherical average of
the radial directional derivative `ω ↦ ⟨∇u(x + r₀ ω), ω⟩`.

This is proved by differentiation under the integral sign, with the local gradient bound coming from
continuity of `fderiv u` on the compact ball `closedBall x (|r₀| + 1)`.  It is the half of the
mean-value property that does *not* need the divergence theorem. -/
