# A shift-uniform exhaustion-tail profile

Radius amplification controls the polynomially growing pointwise amplitude in the far branch.  In
the complementary branch the starting point is bounded in terms of the shift and the dimensionless
radius.  The latter branch is placed beyond a cubic logarithmic cutoff.  Both branches are then
dominated by one cube-root stretched exponential, whose constants depend on the localized split
datum only through `LogGrowthBounds`.
